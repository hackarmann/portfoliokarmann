				<span class="txt">Hi, my name is Anna. 
After I was born and raised in Munich i moved to Berlin at the age of 18. Since then I finished my A-Levels with the focus on fashion and moved on to the University of Applied Sience to study Communication design. I chose this course for its opportunity to learn about the many different parts of design and how I define my own version of it.  I would enjoy to combine my love for travelling and my professional career more in the future.
